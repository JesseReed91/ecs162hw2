This software was created for ECS 162 at UC Davis during the Spring 2024 Quarter for Professor Daryl Posnetts class, it has two games I (Jesse Reed) wrote myself and created all the images for, which are connect 4 and hangman respectively, and an open source math game from GitHub created by Ben Zarras which was under the MIT license. This software will also be using the MIT license, which is included in the repo.

This software includes third party open source software components: math.html, stylesheet.css, and math.js. Please see math/LICENSE.txt for further details.

the data for hangmain.txt was obtained from https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000
